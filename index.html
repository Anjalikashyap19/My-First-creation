                    This is the biggest controversy in the history of India which has been going on since 16th century.
                     According to the Hindu religious texts,
                      the first Ram temple in Ayodhya was stablist by King Kush.
                    and he was succeeded by his 44th generation and the last king of  
                    this generation name was king Brihandbala.
                     After his death the status of Ayodhya and Raam temple was destroyed. 
                     But in 57 AD, King Vikramditya of Ujjain renewate this temple and ayodhya also.
                      In 1526, when Mugal enters first time in india (first rurel Babar) was completely destroyed all
                      the religious places of other religions and stablish there a mosque.Ayodhya Ram mandir is one of them,
                     the mosque which stablish hare  name  is Babri Mahzid .

                Now this issue has been raised that when Babri Masjid was established,
                 then people raised their voice but due to the power of Mughals they could not achieve it.
                  In 1857 when Mughal Empire came to an end and Britishers came to India after that people raised their voice.
                   The first recorded incidents of riots started in 1853.
                    and the case reached the court in 1934 when the pure area was sealed.
                     To solve this problem, first Britishers had separated the pure residential area inside area for the Muslims and  the outer  are
                      But people were not happy with it because it was in one place. Nawaz is also there and puja is also there. 
                      After sealing this whole area, disputes started between people. and the court did not even decide anything.

            From then till today, this issue has been going on in the court for almost 500 years.
             The BJP government supported it and reopened it,
              and Jagatguru Rambhadracharya Ji was the most important witness in all these cases.
               When the judge ask for the proof of Ram Lala's birth in the religious scriptures,
                Rambhadracharay G gives 441 proofs from RINGVED and ATHARWAVED.
                which indicates exactly same place which is issued area.after that the court verify this scriptures,
                 and the decision came in favor of Mandir Nirman.and after the long period controvercy this issue is solved.

                you will feel as if you have come to a temple.
                 Every corner of the country can easily reach Ayodhya through trains, 
                 so that every person can reach Ayodhya easily.
                 Special trains were run from many places to Ayodhya. 
                 Many people traveled on foot to see Ram Lala.
                 the anovation of all over the temple only made for copper ,iron is not use anywhere,
                 also the jewellary of ram lala is very expensive and precious made by different different ratans,
                 like gold silver diamond,moti, manik,panna and also verious of metals and ratnas.
                 this create a very beautiful aura of idiol.
